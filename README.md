# react-testing-demo

Welcome to the React Testing Demo repository! This repository contains a small React, Express, MongoDB application that demonstrates how to write unit tests for a React application using Jest and React Testing Library.

### Getting Started

To get started with this demo, simply clone the repository and run npm install to install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/react-testing-demo.git
cd react-testing-demo
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application using npm start:

```
npm run dev
npm run start
mongod
```

This will start a local development server, express server and mongodb that you can use to view the application in your web browser.

### Running Tests

to run the tests for this application, simply run `npm test`:

This will run all of the unit tests for the application using Jest and React Testing Library. You can find the test files in the src/__tests__ directory.
